                        <h3 style="font-size: 40px">OUR QURAN DEPARTMENT</h3>
                        <p>DAARUL ARQAM ISLAMIC SCHOOLS  believe in connecting our pupils to the most profound text, which formulates the basis of our religion – The Quran.  Starting from preschool, primary and secondary our students learn the Quran from the very basics (reading, reciting, and memorization) to the memorization of entire chapters.</p>
                        <p>Our students learn how to read and recite the Quran with proper tajweed.  They are also introduced to the memorization of the last 10 Surahs of the Quran, as well as other passages such as Ayatul Kursi.  Students also have the opportunity to learn the meaning and the Arabic Language in our Islamic Studies and Arabic classes.</p>
                        <p>Our students from grades 1-3 start a thorough memorization process of the Quran, in which they are expected to have memorized the last three Juz o by the end of grade 3.</p>
                        <p>Starting from grade 4, students are placed in smaller class sizes, are given longer blocks of Quran per week, and continue their memorization at their own pace.  Each student carries a Quran log, which outlines the memorization goals and achievements for the year.  Typically, by the end of grade 7, students memorize seven Juz of the Quran, depending on the commitment of the students and parents.</p>
                        <p>From form one to form four, it is our goal to help a student to memorize ten Juz (if he/she was from our primary section).</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 40px">ISLAMIC STUDIES</h3>
                        <p>The cornerstone of the education for students at DAARUL ARQAM ISLAMIC SCHOOLS is the formation of their Islamic faith. The focus of the Islamic Studies curriculum is to familiarize the students with the Islamic beliefs and practices, and to enhance their understanding of the practical dimension of their faith. The approach we use is designed to instill a love for Allah SWT and an appreciation of the Prophetic example. To accomplish this, students get daily instruction in three basic areas: Islamic Studies, Qur’anic Studies and the Arabic Language.</p>
                        <p>The curriculum is built around a series of value-based themes, and incorporates age-appropriate learning materials and activities. As students progress from one grade level to the other, they learn how to practice the basic rituals of worship, Ibadat, and the Articles of Faith. They learn important parts of the life of Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) and recognize his significance to Muslims and the world. They learn about the lives of other prophets and analyze their stories for important lessons.</p>
                        <p>Students in the higher grades are also introduced to Islamic History and Civilization, and learn about Muslims in the contemporary world.  The Qur’anic studies program consists of the study, memorization, recitation and reading of the Qur’an, and emphasizes the understanding of the Qur’an which will serve as guidance in the lives of students.  For secondary section, ELIMU YA DINI YA KIISLAM is one of the compulsory subject for the candidates in our school. </p>
